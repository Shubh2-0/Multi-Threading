# Multi-Threading 🔄️

Unlike many other programming languages, Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. Multithreaded programming contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each piece of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution. Thus multithreading can be said as a particular version of multitasking.

# What is Multithreading ?
The process of executing multiple tasks (also called threads) simultaneously is called multithreading. The primary purpose of multithreading is to provide simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program to make maximum use of CPU time. A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. It enables programmers to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed simultaneously within a single application.

# What is Multitasking ?

It is the way of executing multiple tasks at a time executing them concurrently over a specified period. Multitasking is done in two ways.

**These are:-**

1️⃣ Process-based multitasking: It is also called multiprocessing where each process has its address in memory, i.e., each process allocates separate memory area.\
2️⃣ Thread-based multitasking: This thread-based multitasking is also termed as multithreading where threads share the same address spac.


# Life Cycle of a Thread 🧬

A thread goes through various stages of its life cycle. Example, first of all, a thread is born, started its tasks, run a sequence of tasks concurrently, and then dies. Here is the diagram of the various stages of a life cycle.
